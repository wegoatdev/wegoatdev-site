There are many things you can do with atom text editor to make you more productive. Installing some [nice packages for atom](my-atom-recommended-packages/) is the first step, now let's go further by learning some shortcut (which means using -mouse- less)!

### Shortcut in atom

- To switch between text editor and the treeview, press <kbd>âŒ˜ + Shift + \ </kbd>, if you're on a file, just press right arrow to switch back to the workspace. There's other alternative by using <kbd>ctrl + 0</kbd> to switch between both.

- Create new file : <kbd>a</kbd> while in treeview

- Create new folder : <kbd>Shift + a</kbd> while in treeview

- Duplicate something : <kbd>d</kbd> while in treeview

- Rename : <kbd> fn + f2 </kbd> or just <kbd> f2 </kbd>

- Searching file or folder: <kbd> cmd + p</kbd>    

- Jump to certain line: <kbd> cmd + p </kbd> and type <kbd>:</kbd> + line's number or with go-to-line package <kbd> ctrl + G</kbd>

- Searching certain text in a file: <kbd> cmd + f</kbd>

- Searching certain text in the whole project: <kbd> cmd + shift + f</kbd>

- Toggle treeview: to make things more clear, you can toggle treeview if you don't need it <kbd> cmd + \ </kbd>

- Select whole line: <kbd> cmd + L </kbd> (In selection menu, you'll see more)

### Other tips
What other things you can do with atom?

- Choose your theme

Spend sometime to choose which theme suite you best, it's worth the time. Press <kbd>cmd + /</kbd> to go to settings or via "Atom menu > preferences", and go to "theme" tab.

In menu > view > panes > split..
