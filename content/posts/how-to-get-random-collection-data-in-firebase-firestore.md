Firebase has a bunch of feature that really help us, but it still lack some of minor things, like how to get a random collection in your data when you are using firebase firestore. Let's learn how to get random collection /data in firebase firestore with a _hacky way_

{{< highlight js >}}  
const ref = db.collection(COLLECTION_NAME).doc();

var items = \[\]  
db.collection(COLLECTION_NAME).where(admin.firestore.FieldPath.documentId(), '>', ref.id).get().then(snapshot => {

       snapshot.forEach(doc => { items.push({  
                        data: doc.data()  
      });

     console.log(items)  
})  
{{< / highlight >}}

notes:

//admin is from firebase admin  
admin   = require('firebase-admin'),
