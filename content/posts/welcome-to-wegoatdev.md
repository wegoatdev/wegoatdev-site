Welcome to wegoatdev, a blog to share around dev topics.

Hey, my name is [Hilman](https://twitter.com/hilmanspace), i come from Indonesia! I always want to write a blog in English, but there's always fear and shame that haunt me. I'm not a native English speaker, so you'll see (i hope not that much) a lot of grammar mistake at first. I'll keep practice and make it better.

I've been a web developer since 2015, and realize how use useful and fun -coding- is, so I share a lot about programming in Bahasa (Indonesian Language), but the time has come.. to practice my English! that's why i make this blog. I'd rather fail to try something I really want rather than regretting not doing it.

The only reason something keep exists is because there's always someone, somewhere, share it to the next person.

Hope this site will be useful!
